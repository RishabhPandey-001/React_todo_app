##  How It Works

* Tasks are stored in **localStorage**, so data remains even after refreshing the page.
* Each task includes:

  * Text
  * Completion status
  * Deadline
  * Priority
  * Subtasks
* Overdue tasks are automatically highlighted if the deadline has passed.

##  Future Enhancements

* User authentication
* Drag & drop task reordering
* Cloud-based database (Firebase / MongoDB)
* Dark mode support
